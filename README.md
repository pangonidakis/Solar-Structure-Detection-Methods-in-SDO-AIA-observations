This is the supporting code for the paper: Gonidakis P. et al., "Comparing Solar Structure Detection Methods in SDO/AIA observations and the application to raw uncalibrated data", submitted to JGR: Machine Learning and Computation

This repository contains:

  1. The YOLOv8n models for
     a. Active region (AR) detection
     b. Coronal hole (CH) detection
  2. The necessary pre-processing pipeline for level-0 (raw data) SDO/AIA to run SCSS-Net, YOLOv8n and BCVO (as described in the paper)
